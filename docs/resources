+# Resources
+
+A curated list of study tools, simulations, and templates to support you throughout the semester.
+
+## Formula and concept sheets
+
+- **Vectors and kinematics:** Common derivatives, component relationships, and unit checks.
+- **Dynamics:** Table of contact forces, free-body diagram templates, and common friction coefficients.
+- **Energy and momentum:** Work–energy theorem, conservation summaries, and impulse–momentum relationships.
+- **Rotation and oscillations:** Torque–angular acceleration links, parallel-axis theorem, and SHM solutions.
+- **Thermal physics:** Ideal gas law, specific heat values, and $p$–$V$ process sketches.
+
+Downloadable PDF templates can be generated from these checklists or recreated in your own notebook.
+
+## Interactive simulations
+
+- [PhET Physics simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/filter?subjects=physics&type=html,prototype): Explore forces, energy skate parks, and wave interference.
+- [MyPhysicsLab](https://www.myphysicslab.com/): View numerical solutions and animations for oscillators and collisions.
+- [Falstad Ripple Tank](https://www.falstad.com/ripple/): Visualize wave superposition and boundary effects.
+
+Use these tools to test predictions before lab or to visualize “what-if” scenarios when solving homework problems.
+
+## Study strategies
+
+??? tip "Spacing and interleaving"
+    Alternate topics (e.g., dynamics problems and energy problems) within a study session. Revisit the same idea 2–3 days later with a fresh problem to reinforce long-term recall.
+
+??? example "Units-first problem solving"
+    Start each solution by listing knowns with units and the target quantity. Keep units in every algebraic step to catch mistakes before plugging numbers.
+
+??? question "How should I summarize a lab?"
+    - State the question and the physical model you used.
+    - Present a figure with labeled axes and include uncertainty bars where appropriate.
+    - Discuss whether data align with the model and how measurement limits might explain discrepancies.
+
+## Support channels
+
+- **Office hours:** Two sessions weekly plus by appointment during exam weeks.
+- **Discussion forum:** Post conceptual questions and solution sketches; mark solved posts for future reference.
+- **Tutoring center:** Free peer tutoring for mechanics and calculus topics; schedule via the university portal.
