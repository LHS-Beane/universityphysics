# Week 1: Units, Dimensions, and 1D Kinematics (with Calculus)

**Sessions Covered:**  
- Oct 21: Units, dimensions, 1D motion  
- Oct 23: Constant acceleration, free-fall, integration in kinematics  

---

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

- Convert between units using dimensional analysis  
- Interpret position, velocity, and acceleration functions  
- Use calculus to derive velocity from position and acceleration from velocity  
- Solve constant- and non-constant-acceleration problems  
- Model free-fall motion using integration

# 📘 1. Units & Dimensions

### Common SI Base Units
| Quantity | Unit | Symbol |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Length | meter | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |

### Derived Units
Acceleration:  
\\[
a = \frac{m}{s^2}
\\]

Force:  
\\[
F = ma = kg\cdot\frac{m}{s^2} = \text{Newton (N)}
\\]

---

# 📘 2. Derivatives in Kinematics

Position → Velocity → Acceleration:

\\[
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}
\\]

\\[
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}
\\]
