+# Syllabus
+
+## Course description
+
+Calculus-based introduction to classical mechanics with extensions to oscillations, waves, and thermodynamics. Emphasis on modeling, multi-representation problem solving, and interpreting experimental data.
+
+## Topics at a glance
+
+- Kinematics in one and two dimensions
+- Newton's laws and common force models (gravity, friction, springs)
+- Work, energy, and potential energy landscapes
+- Linear momentum, collisions, and center-of-mass motion
+- Rotation, torque, and angular momentum
+- Simple harmonic motion and mechanical waves
+- Temperature, heat transfer, and the first law of thermodynamics
+
+## Required materials
+
+- Textbook: any calculus-based University Physics text (e.g., Young & Freedman, or OpenStax *University Physics* Vol. 1–2)
+- Scientific calculator; laptop or tablet for lab data acquisition
+- Lab notebook (bound or digital), graph paper, and ruler
+
+## Grading breakdown
+
+| Component | Weight | Notes |
+| --- | --- | --- |
+| Weekly homework | 20% | problem sets mixing conceptual and quantitative questions |
+| Labs | 20% | pre-lab quizzes + full reports with uncertainty discussion |
+| Midterm exams (2) | 30% | closed-book with formula sheet provided |
+| Final exam | 20% | cumulative emphasis on synthesis |
+| Participation | 10% | in-class polling, group work, and reflections |
+
+Adopt a lowest-score-drop on one homework and one lab to allow for illness or travel.
+
+## Course policies
+
+- **Collaboration:** Discuss approaches with classmates, but write up solutions individually and cite collaborators.
+- **Late work:** 24-hour grace period for homework (−10%); labs require prior approval for extensions.
+- **Academic integrity:** Show all reasoning. Fabricated data or copied solutions are escalated per university policy.
+- **Accessibility:** Contact the instructor within Week 1 to coordinate approved accommodations.
+
+## Assessment timeline
+
+- **Weekly:** Homework due Mondays; lab reports due 48 hours after lab meeting.
+- **Exam 1 (Week 5):** Kinematics, Newton's laws, energy.
+- **Exam 2 (Week 10):** Momentum, rotation, oscillations.
+- **Final (Finals week):** Comprehensive with emphasis on thermodynamics.
