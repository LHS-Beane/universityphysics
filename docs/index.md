# Welcome to Physics 201

## Course Overview
This is the interactive hub for **Physics with Calculus**. Here you will find lecture notes, interactive simulations, and practice problems.

## Mathematics Test
Does this equation render correctly?

$$
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}
$$

If you see a nice Greek integral above, the system is working!
